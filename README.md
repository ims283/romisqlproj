# Lush Sales Analysis SQL Project
## Project Overview
- Project Title: Lush Sales Analysis
- Level: Intermidiate
- Database: romis
This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.
## Objectives
- Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
- Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.
## Dataset Description
### The database contains sales transactions with the following key attributes:
- Customer Demographics: Gender, Age, Age Group
- Order Details: Order ID, Date, Status, Amount
- Product Information: Category, Size
- Sales Channel:Online, In-store, etc.Category, Size
- Shipping Information: City, State, Postal Code
## Project Structure
### Database Setup
- Database Creation: The project starts by creating a database named romis.
- Table Creation: A table named [dbo].[monie works111csv]  is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for Index, Order ID, Custumer ID, Gender, Age, Age Group, Date, Month, Status, Channel, Category, Size, Amount, Ship city, Ship state, Ship postal code.
## Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Record Count: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- Customer Count: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- Category Count: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- Channel Types: Identify all the channels used in the dataset.
- Null Value Check: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.
## Findings
- Customer Demographics: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Kurta, Set, Top, Western Dress and Ethnic dress.
- High-Value Transactions: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 500, indicating premium purchases.
- Sales Trends: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- Customer Insights: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports
- Sales Summary: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- Trend Analysis: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- Customer Insights: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
